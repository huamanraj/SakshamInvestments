    "content": "While concerns over reciprocal tariffs on India may seem alarming, sectoral nuances indicate that the actual impact could be less severe than perceived. The extent of the effect largely depends on how President Trump approaches tariff imposition. Sectors that appear most vulnerable include Automobiles, Gems & Jewelry, Chemicals, and Pharma, but their risk levels vary significantly based on how tariffs are structuredâ€”whether applied broadly across countries or targeted at specific sectors or sub-sectors.\n\nFor instance, India's tariffs on automobiles (100-125%) are substantially higher than those imposed by the US, while auto component tariffs (75-10%) are relatively moderate. The actual exposure of the auto sector, therefore, hinges on the specificity of US tariff implementation. A similar pattern is observed across other vulnerable sectors, where varying tariff rates on sub-components and commodity groups complicate the assessment. Given this complexity, it is likely that the US will impose reciprocal tariffs at a broad country level rather than with a sector-specific focus. However, such tariffs could be rolled back within six months due to increasing economic and political pressure.",

    "content": "Domestic equity markets declined amid ongoing uncertainty surrounding the U.S. President's plans for reciprocal tariffs, raising concerns about a prolonged trade war and potential inflationary pressures. Investor sentiment was further dampened by the U.S. Federal Reserve's statement that it is 'not in a hurry to lower interest rates' and plans to 'pause rate cuts to evaluate further progress in inflation.'\n\nThe market volatility reflects broader concerns about global trade relationships and their impact on emerging markets like India. Key sectors showing resilience include technology services and pharmaceuticals, while traditional manufacturing sectors face headwinds from potential tariff implementations.",

This marks a significant shift in monetary policy stance as the central bank aims to support economic growth while maintaining price stability.\n\nThe rate cut comes amid moderated inflation expectations and signs of economic slowdown in certain sectors. The RBI's decision reflects confidence in the country's inflation trajectory and a commitment to supporting credit growth in the economy. Market participants have responded positively to this accommodative stance, with expectations of further policy support if economic conditions warrant it.",
